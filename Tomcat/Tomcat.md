## Apache Tomcat 

Apache Tomcat, is specifically designed from the ground-up to serve as a Java Servlet engine. 
It's primary purpose is to implement the Java Servlet API and execute Java servlets for the purpose of building dynamic websites. 
Tomcat can also be used as a regular HTTP server that serves static pages, but that is not its primary purpose. 
(Also, Tomcat is allegedly slower than Apache httpd when it comes to serving static pages.)

### Components

Tomcat 4.x was released in 2002 with Catalina (a servlet container), Coyote (an HTTP connector) and Jasper (a JSP engine).
